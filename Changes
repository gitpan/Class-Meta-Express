Revision history for Perl extension Class::Meta::Express.

0.05  2008-05-02T02:15:26
      - Added the "configure_requires", and "recommends" parameters to
        Build.PL.
      - Fixed for Perl 5.6.2.

0.04  2006-08-19T02:31:49
      - Fixed bad example of splicing @_ in the "Overriding Functions"
        documentation.
      - Added the 'class' keyword to make class declarations more natural--
        that is, without needing to call the 'build' function.
      - Deprecated the 'build' function. It will be removed in a future
        release.

0.03  2006-07-04T22:35:42
      - Added ability to override the exported functions by subclassing
        Class::Meta::Express. See the new "Overriding Functions" section of
        the documentation.

0.02  2006-05-30T03:22:30
      - Documented that the 'reexport' parameter to meta() can take a code
        reference argument.
      - Fixed the 'reexport' parameter so that when it is a coderef it
        actually works.
      - Added POD coverage test.
      - Added README to MANIFEST (and therefore to distribution)

0.01  2006-05-30T00:56:44
      - Initial public release.
